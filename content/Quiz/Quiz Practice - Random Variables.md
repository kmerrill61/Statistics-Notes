Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent random variables with:
- $\mu_X = 9.5$, $\sigma_X = 0.4$ (mean and standard deviation of $X$)
- $\mu_Y = 6.8$, $\sigma_Y = 0.1$ (mean and standard deviation of $Y$)

## Question 1: Mean of $3X$

> [!tip] **Formula for the mean of $aX$:**
> $$ \mu_{aX} = a \mu_X $$

For this problem, $a = 3$ and $\mu_X = 9.5$:
$$ \mu_{3X} = 3 \times 9.5 = 28.5 $$

**Answer: $28.5$**

## Question 2: Standard Deviation of $3X$

> [!tip] **Formula for the standard deviation of $aX$:**
> $$ \sigma_{aX} = |a| \sigma_X $$

For this problem, $a = 3$ and $\sigma_X = 0.4$:
$$ \sigma_{3X} = 3 \times 0.4 = 1.2 $$

**Answer: $1.2$**

## Question 3: Mean of $Y - X$

> [!tip] **Formula for the mean of $Y - X$:**
> $$ \mu_{Y - X} = \mu_Y - \mu_X $$

Substitute the given values $\mu_Y = 6.8$ and $\mu_X = 9.5$:
$$ \mu_{Y - X} = 6.8 - 9.5 = -2.7 $$

**Answer: $-2.7$**

## Question 4: Standard Deviation of $Y - X$

> [!tip] **Formula for the standard deviation of $Y - X$:**
> Since $X$ and $Y$ are independent, the variance of the difference is:
> $$ \sigma_{Y - X}^2 = \sigma_Y^2 + \sigma_X^2 $$
> The standard deviation is the square root of the variance:
> $$ \sigma_{Y - X} = \sqrt{\sigma_Y^2 + \sigma_X^2} $$

Substitute the given values $\sigma_Y = 0.1$ and $\sigma_X = 0.4$:
$$ \sigma_{Y - X} = \sqrt{(0.1)^2 + (0.4)^2} = \sqrt{0.01 + 0.16} = \sqrt{0.17} \approx 0.4123 $$

**Answer: $0.4123$**

## Question 5: Mean of $X + 4Y$

> [!tip] **Formula for the mean of $X + 4Y$:**
> $$ \mu_{X + 4Y} = \mu_X + 4\mu_Y $$

Substitute $\mu_X = 9.5$ and $\mu_Y = 6.8$:
$$ \mu_{X + 4Y} = 9.5 + 4 \times 6.8 = 9.5 + 27.2 = 36.7 $$

**Answer: $36.7$**

---

## Question 6: Standard Deviation of $X + 4Y$

> [!tip] **Formula for the standard deviation of $X + 4Y$:**
> For independent random variables, the variance is:
> $$ \sigma_{X + 4Y}^2 = \sigma_X^2 + (4\sigma_Y)^2 $$
> The standard deviation is:
> $$ \sigma_{X + 4Y} = \sqrt{\sigma_X^2 + (4\sigma_Y)^2} $$

Substitute $\sigma_X = 0.4$ and $\sigma_Y = 0.1$:
$$ \sigma_{X + 4Y} = \sqrt{(0.4)^2 + (4 \times 0.1)^2} = \sqrt{0.16 + 0.16} = \sqrt{0.32} \approx 0.5657 $$

**Answer: $0.5657$**
