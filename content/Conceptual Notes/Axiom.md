# Axiom in Statistics

An **axiom** in statistics is a foundational, self-evident truth or assumption that forms the basis for statistical reasoning. These are accepted without proof and serve as starting points for the development of more complex theories and methods.

## Common Axioms in Probability Theory
In the context of probability, several key axioms underpin the theory:

### 1. **Non-negativity Axiom**
   - For any event \( A \), the probability of \( A \) is always non-negative.
   
$$P(A) \geq 0
$$
### 2. **Normalization Axiom**
   - The probability of the sample space \( S \), which represents all possible outcomes, is 1.
   
  $$ P(S) = 1
$$
### 3. **Additivity Axiom**
   - For any two mutually exclusive events \( A \) and \( B \), the probability of either \( A \) or \( B \) occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities.
   
  $$ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
  $$ 
   - This extends to countable collections of mutually exclusive events.

These axioms are part of the **Kolmogorov Axioms** (1933), which form the foundation of modern probability theory.

## Application
- **Probability Axioms**: Used as the foundation for calculating probabilities in real-world scenarios, from rolling dice to analyzing data.
- **Inference**: Statistical inference methods rely on these axioms to derive conclusions from sample data, making them critical to the field.

## Conclusion
Axioms in statistics provide a framework for consistent and rigorous reasoning. They help to ensure that statistical methods are built on solid logical principles.
