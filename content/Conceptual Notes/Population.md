# Population in Statistics

- **Population** refers to the entire set of individuals, items, or data points that you are interested in studying. It represents the complete group from which you want to draw conclusions.

## Examples

- All students in a university
- Every product in a warehouse
- All residents of a city

## Characteristics

- Every individual has the same probability of being included in the sample.
- Selection is typically done using random number generators or drawing names from a hat.

## Related Concepts

- **Sampling Frame**: A list or database that includes all members of the population from which the sample is drawn.
- **Sampling Error**: The difference between the results obtained from a sample and the actual parameters of the population. It is inherent in the sampling process and can be minimized with proper sampling techniques.
- **Stratified Sampling**: A method that divides the population into subgroups (strata) and then randomly samples from each subgroup. This ensures representation across key variables.
